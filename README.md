# String Equation Simulation in Java

## Program Description
This repository contains a simulation program for solving the string equation which also determines the shape of the string at the moment ùë°.

The simulation utilizes the MidPoint method for numerical calculations.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Adjust the input values as desired.
3. Run the calculations.
4. Generated data will be automatically copied to `data.txt` file which user can not only use to visualize the shape of the string at the moment ùë° but also to present energy on the plot.
